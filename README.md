# Overview
This Web Service implements [__identifiers.org__](http://identifiers.org) Namespace Registration API for programmatically submit registration requests.


# Running the Namespace Registration Service
This service can be run in _standalone_ mode, i.e. if you just want to bring this service up for programmatically submit namespace registration requests.

For this version of the service to run in _standalone_ mode you will need a working installation of [Docker](http://docker.com), and credentials to access an SMTP service.
